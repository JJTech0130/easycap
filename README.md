# EasyCAPture

This is an updated version of [usbtv007](https://github.com/memeruiz/usbtv007), which supports:
+ Python 3
+ macOS
+ Output rendered via PyGame
+ Audio output

as well as a bunch of refactoring.
Python is a *tad* inefficient, so I will probably eventually rewrite this in Rust, but it works well enough for now.
